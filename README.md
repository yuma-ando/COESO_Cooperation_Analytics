# COESO_CA
This repository stores Scripts used for COESO Project : Cooperation_Analystics.

The original script was initially developped by Preste(https://www.preste.ai/).

The folder 'Notebook' contains Jupyter Notebook files(ipynb extension) used to develop the script.

The folder 'Integrated_Cooperation_Analytics' contains Python scripts (py extension) : given the data files(to be added in the script), the master py file (main_run.py) file would calculate different indicators of Cooperation Analytics in an automatized process.

For the GDPR compliance, the original data cannot be provided.

The script uses different models, including : 
- "stsb-mpnet-base-v2" : https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/stsb-mpnet-base-v2
- "bart-large-mnli" : https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli
